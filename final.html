      <h2>Motivation:There are many people who are "up to date" in trends in different industries. But there are also some that don't
           know or understand what the latest trends. It might seem shallow but being up to date in different trends in different 
           industries can prove to be beneficial. And although we may not be able to list everything, here are some of the new trends 
           in some of the many different industries.
